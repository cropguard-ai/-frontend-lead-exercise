# Background

A BMI calculator allows you to calculate your body-mass index (BMI). BMIs are one of the health metrics to determine if an average person is underweight or overweight.

# Task

You are given designs for a BMI calculator webpage in `1-page-design.png`. Your task is to implement as much of it as possible in the given time. You are not expected to implement the entire page as this is a big task, so don't feel pressured if you cannot complete it.

The project will be evaluated by the following priority:

1. The functionality of the BMI calculator (e.g. pressing the buttons do what we expect) and the calculated result is correct.
2. The chart is rendered in the default state.
3. The result is displayed in the chart.
4. Fine-tuning your implementation to look as close to the design as possible (e.g. spacing, text fonts, color).

You can choose icons / visuals that look reasonably similar to the designs; they do not have to match exactly.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask your interviewer.
